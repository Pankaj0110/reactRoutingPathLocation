            Go ahead and delete all the files out of the /src directory, and we'll create our own boilerplate file without any bloat. We'll just keep index.css and index.js.

            For index.css, I just copy-and-pasted the contents of Primitive CSS into the file. If you want, you can use Bootstrap or whatever CSS framework you want, or nothing at all. I just find it easier to work with.

export default Details;
